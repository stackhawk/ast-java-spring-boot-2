# RandomBook

This is a REST API built using Spring Boot and JDBC. I created this project to learn some features of Spring Boot. 

The purpose of the web app will be to promote reading by proposing to read a random book of a given category. Each book can be rated and the readings made are tracked.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo with git clone, as usual.

## Running the tests

Test file: src/test/java/com.example.randombook/RandombookApplicationTests.java
It contains basic test operations.
